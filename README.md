## I like pnpm just not the command (let's rename to `P`)

1. Open the `~/.zshrc` file in your preferred text editor.

2. Next, add your alias to the end of the file, save the changes and close the editor.

```bash
alias p='pnpm'
```

3. Run the below source command, which does not provide output, but sources the `~/.zshrc` file to make the alias available in your current shell. `source ~/.zshrc`

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
